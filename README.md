## CHALLENGE 4: Car Rental Availability Program

### Background:

A car rental company wants to offer an improved online experience for  customers by allowing them to browse available vehicles and make informed decisions
before booking.

### Scenario:

David is planning a road trip and needs to rent an SUV. Using the rental
company’s new program, he can quickly browse available vehicles.

The program asks David which type of vehicle he’s looking for. He selects “SUVs.” The
program then shows five SUVs, with details such as the make, model, year, rental price,
and availability. Since David hasn’t found a car he likes yet, he opts to see more options.
The program shows five more SUVs. This time, he finds one that’s perfect for his trip and
decides to stop searching.

Throughout the process, the program ensures that David’s input is valid, such as making
sure he selects a correct vehicle type or responds appropriately when asked if he wants
more options.

### Objective:

The program must help David browse cars, provide accurate vehicle
information, and validate his inputs.

### Extra Considerations:

* Allow users to sort cars by rental price or model year. 
* Implement a booking feature so users can reserve cars directly from the program. 
* Include an option to compare car details side-by-side.

This Github Repo is to streamline the workflow of the team to code the program.
It is also used as documentation until the submission of the source code in UTM E-Learning.
